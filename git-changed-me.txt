As a software engineer, Git revolutionized my workflow. Its version control system allowed me to collaborate seamlessly with teammates, track changes, and maintain code quality. Now, the next step is CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery). With tools like GitHub Actions or others, I can automate testing, build pipelines, and deploy code effortlessly. Excitingly, I’m diving into testing practices to ensure robust software delivery!
